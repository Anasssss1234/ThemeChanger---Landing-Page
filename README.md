# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# How I made this Project 
so , Guys i have made this small project. my main motive while making this project was to add a functionality of Theme changer
as we see in many applications and website that there is a themechnager icon so when we tap on that button our theme has changed to dark mode and again if we tap that button so that has changed to light mode which looks so attractive so exactly the same way i add this functionality to in this project.

# How can someone open this project ?
so, Basically you will have to open a VS code (Visual Studio Code) and if you don't have so you can download it from chrome or from any other browser that you use . Once you open the Vs code then you will have to change the directory (cd and name of that file) which you want to open then run a command "npm run dev" beacuse i have made this through React + Vite so you will have to run this command otherwise, you wil not be able to open this project. now finally you can see this project.

# This is How you can run this Project.
